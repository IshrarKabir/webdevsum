<p>5. 6 Train: In terms of reliability it's 4/10. Extremely packed. Too many delays. However, it saves me a significant amount of time walking to campus. The only reason it's on this list.</p>
<br>
<p>4. N Train: N train is pretty reliable as it has both local and express service. It connects Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn. This train can be extremely crowded sometimes. </p>
<br>
<p>3. E Train: E tarin is reliable and it's waiting time is not bad. It connects Queens with Manhattan. However it can be really crowded and dirty during rush hour. It's usually express and saves a lot of time. Overall it is good.</p>
<br>
<p>2. F Train: F train is very reliable due to its frequent service. The F train connects Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn and can take you anywhere. It connects significant stations and locations in the city, making it extremely dependable, yet it also makes it busy. It may be a really dirty sometimes. However, it is my number two choice due to its express service, shorter wait times, and connectivity. </p>
<br>
<p>1. 7 Train: This train is very dependable and punctual. It connects Queens and Manhattan.Like the F train, the 7 train makes stops in large stations, making it easy to transfer to other trains. It can get packed at times, but it is less dirty and safer than most other trains. </p>
